This project has 2 main files, client.cpp and server.cpp. The server generates an IP address that can be used by the client to connect to it. The port is preset in the server. The client can be run with the following command: ./client <ip address> <port> <file>

The client-side android application has three files, androidmanifest.xml, mainactivity.java and activity_main.xml. . The AndroidManifest.xml file governs the overall configuration of the app, while MainActivity.java handles the application logic, and activity_main.xml dictates the visual layout of the user interface.
